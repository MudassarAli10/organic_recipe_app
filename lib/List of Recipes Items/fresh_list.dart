            "• 3 tablespoons minced fresh chives\n"
            "• ½ cup cold buttermilk",
    "instruction":
        "\nStep 1 \n      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet (or similar-size 2-quart baking dish) with cooking spray.\n\nStep 2 \n      Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft, 4 to 6 minutes. Add garlic, thyme and rosemary; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add kale; cook, stirring often, until tender and wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup flour and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Stir in broth, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans and 1/2 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan.\n\nStep 3 \n      To prepare biscuits: Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut or rub butter into the dry ingredients. Stir in chives. Add buttermilk and stir until just combined. Form the dough into 6 biscuits and place on top of the vegetable mixture. Lightly brush with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil. Place the potpie on a baking sheet.\n\nStep 3 \n      Bake until the biscuits are lightly browned and the filling is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving.\n\nTips  \n      Try white whole-wheat flour in place of all-purpose flour in baked goods. It's made from hard white wheat berries, which makes it lighter in color and flavor than regular whole-wheat flour, but with the same nutritional properties. Look for it near other whole-grain flours. For the best flavor, store it airtight in the freezer."

        "• ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar\n"
        "• 2 large eggs, at room temperature\n"
        "• 1 orange\n",
    "instruction":
        "Step 1 \n       Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Heavily grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans (see Equipment Tip).\n\nStep 2 \n        To prepare meringue: Wipe a bit of vinegar over the whisk attachment and mixing bowl of a stand mixer to ensure it's completely clean and free from any lingering fat residue. (Alternatively, you can use a handheld electric mixer.) Add egg whites to the bowl, making sure there's no yolk; beat on low speed until they bubble and begin to froth. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat until they are foamy and doubled in size. With the mixer running, gradually add 1 cup sugar, 1 heaping teaspoon at a time. When all the sugar has been added, turn off the mixer and give the sides of the bowl a quick scrape. Then beat on medium-high until the meringue is smooth and glossy with stiff peaks. Add vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon vinegar; beat until just incorporated. Transfer the meringue to a clean bowl and set aside.\n\nStep 3 \n        To prepare cake: Swap out or rinse your mixing bowl and switch the mixer's whisk attachment for the paddle attachment. Whisk flour and baking powder in a small bowl; set aside.\n\nStep 4 \n        With the mixer on medium speed, beat 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup sugar until light and creamy. Add egg yolks one at a time, mixing well between each. Add milk; scrape the sides of the bowl, if necessary. (It's OK if the batter curdles a little.) With the mixer running, add the flour mixture and beat until just combined. The batter will be thick and sticky, like a soft cookie dough.\n\nStep 5 \n        Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared pans. Sprinkle some flour over the top and use your fingers to press the batter evenly across the bottom of the pans. If the batter sticks to your fingers, add more flour. The layer will be quite thin and should not be sticky.\n\nStep 6 \n        Divide the meringue and spread half on top of each cake layer, smoothing out the tops. Sprinkle 1/2 cup almonds over the top of each meringue.\n\nStep 7 \n        Just before you place the cakes in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F. Bake the cakes for 25 minutes, taking care not to open the oven while they bake.\n\nStep 8 \n        Meanwhile, prepare orange curd: Zest and juice orange, setting the zest aside for later (you should have 1/4 cup juice and 1 1/2 teaspoons zest; reserve any extra for another use). Beat butter and sugar with the mixer on medium speed until light and creamy. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well between each. Add the orange juice and mix until combined. (The mixture may curdle, but it will smooth out as it cooks.).\n\nStep 9 \n        Transfer the mixture to the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water (see Tip); cook, whisking constantly, until thick and glossy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in orange zest. Set aside to cool.\n\nStep 10 \n        When the cakes have baked for 25 minutes, turn off the oven and prop the oven door open with a wooden spoon. Leave the cakes in the gradually cooling oven for 10 minutes, then let cool in the pans on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes more..\n\nStep 11  \n        When you're ready to assemble the torte, gently remove the cake layers from the pans (almond-side up). Place one layer on a serving plate. Spread the cooled orange curd on top, then carefully place the second layer on top. Serve immediately or refrigerate, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.\n\n\nTips\b\n\n        To make ahead: Refrigerate the orange curd (Steps 8-9) in an airtight container for up to 1 day. Bring to room temperature before assembling the cake. Refrigerate the finished cake, loosely covered with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days.\n\nEquipment: Two 9-inch aluminum or stainless-steel (not nonstick) cake pans or cheesecake pans with straight sides and removable bottoms. Alternatively, use springform pans (make sure they're not nonstick), or use disposable 9-inch foil pie pans and carefully cut and peel the edges away to remove the baked cakes.\n\nTip: To improvise a double boiler, bring 2 inches of water to a simmer in a large saucepan. Then set a medium or large metal bowl over the simmering water. Allow at least 1 inch of space between the water and the bottom of the bowl."

        "• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
    "instruction":
        "Step 1 \n       To prepare crust: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nStep 2 \n        Combine butter, brown sugar and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Beat with the paddle attachment until smooth. Add honey and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla; mix until combined. Add flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt; mix until combined. Form the dough into quarter-size chunks, about 1/2-inch thick, on the prepared pan. Bake until golden brown and firm around the edges, about 20 minutes.\n\nStep 3 \n        Transfer the crust pieces on the parchment to a wire rack and cool for 30 minutes. Pulse in a food processor until finely ground.\n\nStep 4 \n       Coat a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray. Mix the crust crumbs with oil in a medium bowl; press into the bottom and about 1 1/2 inches up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake until set, about 8 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.\n\nStep 5 \n       Meanwhile, to prepare filling: Put a kettle of water on to boil for the water bath. Combine cream cheese, sugar, lavender and salt in the stand mixer bowl. Beat with the paddle attachment until smooth and fluffy, scraping down the sides as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing and scraping the bowl after each addition. Add lemon juice and vanilla; mix until combined.\n\nStep 6 \n       Tightly wrap the outside of the pan, bottom and sides, with heavy-duty foil. Pour the filling into the crust. Place the springform pan in a roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come 1 inch up the side of the springform pan to create a hot water bath. Carefully transfer the roasting pan to the center of the oven. Bake until the cheesecake is set around the edges but the center still jiggles slightly, 1 to 1 1/4 hours.\n\nStep 6 \n       Let the cheesecake cool in the water bath on a wire rack until the water is room temperature, about 1 hour. Remove the pan from the water and remove the foil. Refrigerate, uncovered, until very cold, at least 4 hours.\n\n\nTips\b\n\n        To make ahead: Refrigerate for up to 3 days.\nEquipment: Parchment paper, 9-inch springform pan, heavy-duty foil."
